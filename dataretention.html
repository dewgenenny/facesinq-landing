        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>FaceSinq is committed to respecting your privacy and ensuring the secure management of user data. This Data Retention Policy explains how we handle, store, and manage data collected through our Slack-integrated application.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Types of Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>FaceSinq collects limited data from Slack, including user names and encrypted links to profile photos. This information is gathered for the purpose of generating personalized quizzes to help users learn and remember their colleagues' names.</p>

        <h2>Retention Period</h2>
        <p>We retain user data only as long as it is necessary to provide our service effectively. Specifically:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Information:</strong> User names and profile photo links are retained while the user is actively using FaceSinq and remains part of the associated Slack workspace.</li>
            <li><strong>Inactive Users:</strong> If a user becomes inactive or leaves the workspace, we will retain the user's data for a maximum of 90 days, after which the data will be permanently deleted from our systems.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Data Deletion Requests</h2>
        <p>Users or workspace administrators can request the deletion of their data at any time. Upon receiving a deletion request, we will remove all associated user information within 30 days. Requests can be submitted through our <a href="support.html">Support Page</a>.</p>

        <h2>Secure Data Management</h2>
        <p>All user data is securely encrypted, including profile photo links, to protect privacy. We implement strict access controls to ensure that data is only accessible by authorized personnel for providing core app functionality.</p>

        <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>We may update this Data Retention Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Users will be notified of significant changes, and continued use of FaceSinq after updates indicates acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
